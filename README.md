# Learning-Python
All materials and programs I used/made for learning a Python

Media Sorter:
Drop into directory with folder named "ToSort" which contains media files (img, mp4). On run it will sort all files in directory into
different directories, based on file type and (if file is an img file) date of creation. This script is very useful if you have a lot
of unsorted pictures and videos on you PC like me (perk of having 3yo kid)
